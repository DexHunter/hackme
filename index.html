    Back After figuring about the configuration in the jekyll, I am finally able to write posts again. But I need to know how to customize the style and add mathjax etc. support since I will be writing more on my project later.
To I am currently helping writing a paper on trading using DL with friends. Seldom other students realize how amazing this project is but I will surprise them.

          <h2><a href="https://dexhunter.github.io/hackme/post/learning-from-history/">Learning from History</a></h2>
<div>
  
    Digital History Recently, I was reading the innovators by Walter Isaacson. This is particularly interesting book to me because I was always fascinated by how computer is created or invented. We enjoy so much about Internet, laptop, namingly new technology without single clue on who invented or how those are invented. The book told the story of digital world and how the digital world come into beings. I love the idea of combining creative genius and practical engieers to form a strong team thus transforming the entire history.

<div>
  
    Finally, I finished the book the Innovators which I was borrowed from library about half year ago. Shortly after summer vacation begins, I said to myself I need to finish the book and with determination I read through the book. Here are some my thoughts on the book which will be in a backwards order of the book.
Augmented Human Intellect vs. Artificial Intelligence Since I was doing research on AI and my dream is to build an AGI bot, I find the last chapter Ada Forever particularily interesting because it strikes me that AI reseach has been carried out for more than 35 years and every few years media will report there is a breakthrough and super-intelligence is born.
