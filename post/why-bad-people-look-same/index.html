<h1 id="bill-o-reilly-others">Bill O&rsquo;Reilly &amp; Others</h1>

<p>I first learned Bill O&rsquo;Reilly was when I trying to find the book from O&rsquo;Reilly Media. Since O&rsquo;Reilly has published some books from best computer scientists, I was looking for where can I download the book for free online. But I ended up on Bill O&rsquo;Reilly&rsquo;s website. It seems he also wrote some books. I was first mislead by the name, I thought he was the owner of O&rsquo;Reilly Media. Fortunately, he has nothing to do with it except the name.</p>

<p>Then I saw the youtube video where he invited Jon Stewart to his show and has a lot of argues. The title was something like &ldquo;John Stewart exposed the stupidity of Bill O&rsquo;Reilly&rdquo;. It was clear the uploader does not like Bill. But anyway, when I first see the face of Bill O&rsquo;Reilly. I felt &ldquo;wow, this dude is angry&rdquo;. When I watched some clips of his video, it came to me that Bill is not a friendly dude at all. He is very aggressive but seems to be popular. Today, I learned that maybe he is not popular but rather notorious.</p>

<p>When I saw his photo, I do not know if it&rsquo;s because I am a slient observer or it&rsquo;s his chi or qi that makes me feel this is an asshole dude. He is obviously not friendly but why do I feel that he is an total asshole just from his look?  I think the reason lies on his body language. It is very subtle but powerful for silent observers like me to figure out the personality of the person. I thought I should not have judged people by their appearance. But many times the first impression is very import and complicated. The old Chinese saying is &ldquo;相由心生&rdquo; which means the appearance comes from the heart(or personality in our case). Through many years of experience, I found out this makes sense to some extent. The look is important. When I looked myself in the mirror, I sometimes will have an illution that dude is not me. He looks weird. But when I was in a good mood, I found the dude in the mirror attractive.  Now since I was doing computer vision I totally understand it.</p>
