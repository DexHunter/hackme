<p>Finally, I finished the book <em>the Innovators</em> which I was borrowed from library about half year ago. Shortly after summer vacation begins, I said to myself I need to finish the book and with determination I read through the book. Here are some my thoughts on the book which will be in a backwards order of the book.</p>

<h1 id="augmented-human-intellect-vs-artificial-intelligence">Augmented Human Intellect vs. Artificial Intelligence</h1>

<p>Since I was doing research on AI and my dream is to build an AGI bot, I find the last chapter <em>Ada Forever</em> particularily interesting because it strikes me that AI reseach has been carried out for more than 35 years and every few years media will report there is a breakthrough and super-intelligence is born. But the truth is there is always &ldquo;another twenty years&rdquo;. Artifical intelligence still cannot &lsquo;originate&rsquo; anything, or at least for now. Thus, my research will focus more on &lsquo;human-machine symbiosis&rsquo; rather than making AI do all the jobs alone. Even though I am not a big fan of humanity, Augmented Human Intellect is probably a right thing to focus. And I believe this will benefit humanity maximumly.</p>

<h1 id="insights-on-collaborative-work">Insights on collaborative work</h1>

<p>To be honest, I do not like to be with other people working. I feel intimidating and am easily distracted from my own work. Lack of focusing is my biggest problem currently and I am trying to avoid all the distraction so that I can focus on the job I am working on. But I have to admit that the author Walter Isaacson did a amazing job and convinced me that the innovation in digital age happened mostly from collaborative works, usually consists of a visionary and an engineer. Complementary team works best.</p>

<h1 id="best-part-of-the-book">Best Part of the book</h1>

<p>To me, the best part of this book is the history of digital age. I was born and raised mostly in China in 2000s, so I never really have a chance to learn how digital &lsquo;revolution&rsquo; formed. What is the order of invention and what is the mechanism behind all these fantastic contraptions? This book answers my question.</p>
