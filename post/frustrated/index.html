        <p>I feel really frustrated recently.</p>

<p></p>

<p>There are a lot of things going on and I have a lot of things to do. I am a lazy yet quick-learning person. I feel frustrated when I couldn&rsquo;t get things done. Moreover, the things need to be done are accumulating which means I need to do things needed to be done yesterday at current day. And it&rsquo;s frustrating.</p>

<p>I figure why I could not get things done:
1. I am easily distracted. I keep switching to different tasks.
2. Some task are beyond my level/ I overestimated myself. There is a feature in our project I want to build, I spent several hours trying to implement it and failed (not exactly failed, but I did not finish). I think maybe I need more time or maybe I need some new ideas. (like I need to write from scratch)
3. I did not find the right way to tackle the problem. As reason 2 pointed out, the reason why I am so ineffective is probably caused by myself.
4. My temper is bad. I had to admit, as a marverick I have strong opinions on a lot of things which makes me less likable. Sometimes, I am also very disappointed at myself.</p>

<p>There are some other ongoings:
1. military training: this shit really troubles me a lot. In China, it is required to do military traininng for at least 7 days. The only thing they ask you to do is standing there for 5 hours which is fine if I do not have other things to do. But the time period of military training is around final exam, which makes me unavailable. Besides, I really think this is total waste of time to just stand there and doing nothing. I would be better off watching anime.
2. hackathon: even though I have won the championship of hack x fdu 2017, there are still many hackathons that I can attend. I feel frustrated that some of students from the same university as mine went without telling me and they did not win but make a scene. This is kind of werid for me to care about them but since our university is relatively new, I think they are spreading a bad impression.
3. univeristy: I have talked with some teachers about start a training class for novice students but they did not respond at all. I tried to hold a event to teach deep reinforcement learning but most students could not even use git right. I feel really sad but I don&rsquo;t think I am able to change the situation. I hope they could learn more about the software development. But the sad truth is that they won&rsquo;t listen to me since I am basically hold a same position as theirs.</p>

<p>Although I met all those problems, I believe I am able to resolve most of them in few days. Besides, on the bright side, I am healthy and totally fine. I knew a friend who is paralyzed so I am fortunate to have a healthy body and mind.</p>
