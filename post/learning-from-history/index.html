<h1 id="digital-history">Digital History</h1>

<p>Recently, I was reading <em>the innovators</em> by Walter Isaacson. This is particularly interesting book to me because I was always fascinated by how computer is created or invented. We enjoy so much about Internet, laptop, namingly new technology without single clue on who invented or how those are invented. The book told the story of digital world and how the digital world come into beings. I love the idea of combining creative genius and practical engieers to form a strong team thus transforming the entire history. Once somehting has been invented or put together, people stop think it is a myth anymore. I think this is the beauty of it that challenges our mind.</p>

# Why China has a unsustainable problem?

I lived in China for more than 20 years now. I have relatives working in the government and lived in a military-restricted area for about 10 years. From my observation and what I have read, Chinese government want a "stable" society which to me is like a brain-dead society because the media is controlled by government and when a really terrible policy comes out, they will broadcast and ask so-called experts explaining why the policy is so "great". Even the media in Hong Kong is somewhat related to the central goverment. Some people will object me saying you are making no sense how could you tell whether a policy is good or bad. This is true to some extent, since as an independent individual, my opinion is biased based on what will benefit me personally, however I think if the policy will affect me, it will definitely affect others as well since we are all Chinese citizens. 

Let me give you a recent example and explain why this is unsustainable - the "VPN ban". So according to [the news](https://www.forbes.com/sites/leonhardweese/2017/01/25/what-does-chinas-vpn-ban-really-mean/#2c35823b50e3)[1], it will be illegal to use VPNs in China from 2018. Firstly, this is rather ridiculous to me because why have GFW (Great FireWall) in the first place? What are the government afraid of? I lived abroad for several years and did not think the Internet will damage the government if the poeple being ruled have an independent views on the subject. Secondly, this kills creativity. I never believes in race theory so I think Chinese are as creative as anyone else. The stereotype is that Chinese students are nerds but to me, they can be creative as well if given the environment. You can search on bilibili and find fantastic videos made by Chinese people. The sad truth is that Chinese cannot share their creativity with the rest world because of GFW. Thirdly, it drives intelligent away. Well, not to all if the government give the national treatment to intelligent individuals such as Chen-Ning Franklin Yang. But can you give any scientists with this kind of treatment? If not, other brilliant people will just go abroad and never come back, which is also a sad truth.

Above all, I put freedom of speech as the most fundamental privilege an individual should enjoy, and I hope that one day Chinese government can learn this bitter truth.

Another observation I had is that not many people know how a thing works even though they have no trouble using it like my father.
