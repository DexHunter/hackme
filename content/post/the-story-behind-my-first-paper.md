title: "The Story behind My First Paper"
---

So it is settled that my first co-authored paper is going to be put on arxiv soon. I am excited to see that. Not only because this is my FIRST paper, but also this symbolizes my first step towards Apple's slogan "push human race forward". (Even though I am not a big fan of Apple but I have to admit they do have inspiring slogan)

Here I want to share with my audience about the story behind how did I hear the project and have the privilege to participate in the project.

## How did I know this project?

This is story of my personality. Last November, I was checking on wechat and found that one of my wechat friend Zhengyao has posted one of his Github project - snake game in assembly. I thought it impossible that someone could write that using Microsoft inline assembly language (which really sucks BTW). So I checked out his Github project and to my amazement he really did it. Then I went on and checked rest of his open github repositories and found one interetd me - 2016SURF which is this weird project using cnn to do portfolio management. I told myself this seems interesting. So I sent an email to Dr. Liang and he replied I can come. At that time I barely know how to write programs in python, but they did not really give me anything to do anyways. 

But I was determined to learn python at that time (well, actually I did some programs in python at high school but I did not know python well enough). Then it was the final exam of that semester and winter vacation. I procrastinated reviewing my exam to finish exercises of *Think Python*. And just before the new semester I finished the book and put all my code [online](https://github.com/DexHunter/TP_solutions). When the new semester started, Dr. Liang gave me a task to write a trading library. He told me if I can finish it he will put my name to the paper as well. Zhengyao told me this was a very important paper because they made some breakthroughs based on the last paper. So I worked hard and finished all the algorithms (I probably will open source it later).

This is basically the story how I got my first paper. Through this process, I found myself doing the things I always dreamed of - creating new ideas and implementing them. I feel blessed to be part of the project. I will keep working hard and hopefully one day I can really "push human race forward".

## The qulity of research in our university

I am currently in Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool Univeristy, Suzhou, China. The quality of research is not very high if you compared with world-known universities. But it is better than average Chinese universities and since our teaching language is English, the communication between academia is easier than a normal Chinese university. However, I am not satisfied with the result. I have two SURF(summer undergraduate research fellowship) projects this summer(one on my name and another I am part-time). I wrote my surf project so I think the one I am doing is of high quality. But I read through the surf list and found a lot of surf projects are BS, the content is like my side-project or even worse. For example, build a selfless-driving car using lego. You don't need to 2 months to do that. A lot of resources are online already and people have built that like thousands of times. Others in other fields. Even though I am probably biased I suppose the content are of low quality in most of research projects in our university. After all, our university is still based in China and limited under Chinese rules.
