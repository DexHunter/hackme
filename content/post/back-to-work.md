## Back

After figuring about the configuration in the jekyll, I am finally able to write posts again. But I need to know how to customize the style and add mathjax etc. support since I will be writing more on my project later.

## To

I am currently helping writing a paper on trading using DL with friends. Seldom other students realize how amazing this project is but I will surprise them.

## Work

Check my github later.

Cheers!
