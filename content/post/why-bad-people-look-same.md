# Bill O'Reilly & Others
I first learned Bill O'Reilly was when I trying to find the book from O'Reilly Media. Since O'Reilly has published some books from best computer scientists, I was looking for where can I download the book for free online. But I ended up on Bill O'Reilly's website. It seems he also wrote some books. I was first mislead by the name, I thought he was the owner of O'Reilly Media. Fortunately, he has nothing to do with it except the name. 

Then I saw the youtube video where he invited Jon Stewart to his show and has a lot of argues. The title was something like "John Stewart exposed the stupidity of Bill O'Reilly". It was clear the uploader does not like Bill. But anyway, when I first see the face of Bill O'Reilly. I felt "wow, this dude is angry". When I watched some clips of his video, it came to me that Bill is not a friendly dude at all. He is very aggressive but seems to be popular. Today, I learned that maybe he is not popular but rather notorious. 

When I saw his photo, I do not know if it's because I am a slient observer or it's his chi or qi that makes me feel this is an asshole dude. He is obviously not friendly but why do I feel that he is an total asshole just from his look?  I think the reason lies on his body language. It is very subtle but powerful for silent observers like me to figure out the personality of the person. I thought I should not have judged people by their appearance. But many times the first impression is very import and complicated. The old Chinese saying is "相由心生" which means the appearance comes from the heart(or personality in our case). Through many years of experience, I found out this makes sense to some extent. The look is important. When I looked myself in the mirror, I sometimes will have an illution that dude is not me. He looks weird. But when I was in a good mood, I found the dude in the mirror attractive.  Now since I was doing computer vision I totally understand it.
