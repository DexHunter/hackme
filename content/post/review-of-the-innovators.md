title: "Review of *the Innovators*"
---

Finally, I finished the book *the Innovators* which I was borrowed from library about half year ago. Shortly after summer vacation begins, I said to myself I need to finish the book and with determination I read through the book. Here are some my thoughts on the book which will be in a backwards order of the book.

# Augmented Human Intellect vs. Artificial Intelligence

Since I was doing research on AI and my dream is to build an AGI bot, I find the last chapter *Ada Forever* particularily interesting because it strikes me that AI reseach has been carried out for more than 35 years and every few years media will report there is a breakthrough and super-intelligence is born. But the truth is there is always "another twenty years". Artifical intelligence still cannot 'originate' anything, or at least for now. Thus, my research will focus more on 'human-machine symbiosis' rather than making AI do all the jobs alone. Even though I am not a big fan of humanity, Augmented Human Intellect is probably a right thing to focus. And I believe this will benefit humanity maximumly.

# Insights on collaborative work

To be honest, I do not like to be with other people working. I feel intimidating and am easily distracted from my own work. Lack of focusing is my biggest problem currently and I am trying to avoid all the distraction so that I can focus on the job I am working on. But I have to admit that the author Walter Isaacson did a amazing job and convinced me that the innovation in digital age happened mostly from collaborative works, usually consists of a visionary and an engineer. Complementary team works best.

# Best Part of the book

To me, the best part of this book is the history of digital age. I was born and raised mostly in China in 2000s, so I never really have a chance to learn how digital 'revolution' formed. What is the order of invention and what is the mechanism behind all these fantastic contraptions? This book answers my question.
