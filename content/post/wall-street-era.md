Summary: Review of 《乱世华尔街》

<!--more-->

Recently, I read a *violent era of wall street* by Yu Yan. The book talks about author's experience as a trader at Wall Street between 2006 and 2009. 

Here are some take aways I learnt:
* The easiest way to get rich is playing at **new game**
* pay attention to market liquity, it could be the last straw to break camel's back
* pay attention to network (distribution channel) A Goldman Saying *If we serve our clients well, our own success will follow*
* do not invest stock.
